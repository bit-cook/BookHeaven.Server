<h1 align="center">BookHeaven Server</h1>

BookHeaven Server is part of the BookHeaven "ecosystem", which aims to provide a very convenient way to manage and read your ebook library.<br/>
It allows to organize your books into authors and series, as well as add tags for filtering purposes.<br/>
You can also add fonts so they can be easily downloaded and used by your devices.

## :sparkles: Features
- :computer: **Modern and responsive UI**
- :mag: **Auto discovery**: The server can be discovered by the client app automatically, so you don't have to manually configure it.
- :label: **Metadata handling (title, author, etc)**: Metadata is read from the ebook itself and editable at any time. Any changes, including the cover, are persisted back into the file.
- :cloud: **Metadata fetching**: You can fetch covers and metadata from the internet.
- :clock10: **Progress tracking**[^1]: You can check the progress of your books at any given time, but also set it manually.
- :a: **Font types management**[^2]: Any font that you configure will be made available for your devices to easily download and use.
- :busts_in_silhouette: **Profiles**: You can create multiple profiles to keep your reading progress separate.
- :book: **OPDS Support**: Just add /opds to your server URL.

[^1]: Progress tracking includes start date, last read date, percentage, elapsed time as well as finished date.
[^2]: Fonts can be split up into any combination of styles (regular, italic) and weights (normal, bold) or you can also use a single font file for everything.

## :globe_with_meridians: Supported UI Languages
- English
- Spanish (features might release without translation for a while, but I'll try to keep up)

## :rocket: Getting Started
Setting the server up is pretty straightforward using containers.
> [!NOTE]
> Check out the [starting guide](https://bookheaven.ggarrido.dev/getting-started) for more information.

> [!WARNING]

      - ./data:/app/data
      # optional: if you want to import books by copying them directly into a folder on your host
      - ./import:/app/import
    ports:
      # web ui
      - 8080:8080
